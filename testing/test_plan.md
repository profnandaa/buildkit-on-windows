# Test Plan for BuildKit on Windows (WCOW)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the testing strategy and approach for validating the BuildKit on Windows environments, an mainly for WCOW (Windows Container on Windows) scenarios. The primary goal is to ensure there are no regressions when compared to (classic/current) `docker build` on Windows and to verify that BuildKit enhances build performance and efficiency as expected.

### 1.2 Scope

The test plan covers functional, performance, integration, and usability testing of the BuildKit on Windows. It includes tests for common Dockerfile instructions, build performance, compatibility with existing Docker workflows, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### 1.3 Test Environment

- Windows Server versions (e.g., 2019, 2022)
- Windows 10 and Windows 11 for desktop environments
- Docker versions (_to be specified_)
- ~~Hardware configurations (not in scope for now)~~

## 2. Test Items

- Building with `buildctl build` vs classic `docker build`
- Dockerfile parsing and execution
- Build caching mechanisms
- Concurrent and parallel builds
- Build context handling (local, remote)
- Secret management during builds
- Network settings during build

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Functional Testing

- **Dockerfile Instructions**: Test all Dockerfile instructions (e.g., `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) to ensure they behave as expected with BuildKit.
- **Build Contexts**: Test various build contexts, including local directories, git repositories, and remote URLs.
- **Secrets and SSH Agents**: Test the ability to use secrets and SSH agents during build processes without exposing sensitive information.

### 3.2 Performance Testing

- **Build Time Comparison**: Compare build times between BuildKit and the legacy build system across various Dockerfiles.
- **Resource Utilization**: Measure CPU, memory, and disk usage during builds to ensure BuildKit does not introduce excessive overhead.
- **Caching Efficiency**: Evaluate the effectiveness of BuildKit's caching mechanisms by measuring build times with and without cache.

### 3.3 Integration Testing

- **Docker Compose**: Test integration with Docker Compose to ensure BuildKit can build images as part of multi-container applications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate BuildKit into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to validate compatibility and performance improvements in automated workflows.

### 3.4 Usability Testing

- **Error Messaging**: Evaluate the clarity and usefulness of error messages generated by BuildKit.
- **Documentation**: Test the accuracy and completeness of documentation for using BuildKit with Docker on Windows.

## 4. Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Status |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| TC1          | Build an image using a basic Dockerfile with BuildKit | Image is built successfully without errors |                |        |
| TC2          | Rebuild an image with cache | Build time is reduced using cache |                |        |
| ...          | ...         | ...              |                |        |

## 5. Test Deliverables

- Test plan document.
- Test cases execution report.
- Performance comparison report.
- Issue reports for any discovered bugs or regressions.
- Recommendations for improvements.

## 6. Risks and Dependencies

- Compatibility issues with specific Windows versions or configurations
- Performance may vary based on hardware and workload
- Dependencies on external services (e.g., git repositories) for some test cases
